## Important Notes  
### Instructions for use
1. **Maintain ventilation:** Although smoke purifiers can effectively filter smoke and odors, it is recommended that the work area be properly ventilated to ensure air quality when conditions permit.
2. **Check the filter status regularly: **The filter will gradually become saturated after long-term use, affecting the purification effect. Please check regularly whether the filter needs to be replaced to ensure that the smoke purifier always operates efficiently.
3. **Control the humidity of the environment: **The filtering effect of the filter pack will be affected in a humid environment. Please try to avoid using the smoke purifier in a place with high air humidity.
4. **Correct connection and installation:** Before use, make sure the smoke purifier is correctly connected to the laser cutting machine to avoid air leakage to give full play to the purification effect of the filter.

### Filter replacement cycle and replacement method
Regular replacement of the filter pack helps extend the life of the TOOCAA smoke purifier and keeps the working environment clean and healthy.

**Replacement cycle: **The replacement frequency of the filter pack depends on the frequency of use and the air quality of the working environment. It is generally recommended to replace the main filter and the middle filter after 3-6 months of cumulative use, and the pre-filter after 7-14 days of cumulative use. If you notice that the filtration effect of the smoke purifier has decreased, the smoke smell has increased significantly, or the air volume has decreased, you may need to replace the filter in advance.



**How to Replacement:**

1. **Turn off the equipment:** Make sure both the TOOCAA L2 laser cutter and the fume purifier are turned off and unplugged.
2. **Open the filter compartment cover:** According to the instructions for the use of the smoke purifier, find the location of the filter compartment and open it.
3. **Remove the old filter:** Carefully remove the old filter package and avoid shaking it to prevent dust from being dispersed.
4. **Install a new filter:** Place the new filter package into the filter compartment according to the indicated direction, ensuring a good seal.
5. **Reset and test:** Close the filter compartment cover, connect the power supply, turn on the device, and check whether the device is operating normally.
