# Offline Operation Guide

The accessory box of the TOOCAA L2 includes a TF card, so no additional preparation is required.

## **Creating a Sample Project**

### **Step 1/5**  
Insert the TF card into the computer using a card reader. After completing the design in TOOCAA Studio or LightBurn, save the design file to the TF card in Gcode format.
