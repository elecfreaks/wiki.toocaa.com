## Rotary Accessory Installation Guide

1. As shown in the figure, turn the chuck knob clockwise to unlock and counterclockwise to lock. Adjusting the knob allows the jaws to expand or contract for easier insertion of the rotary jaws.

3. After completing your design on the canvas, perform a **Frame** operation.  
   Ensure the processing area is positioned on the material to prevent the laser from cutting into the machine.

4. Once framing is complete, select the focusing method based on material hardness:
   - For hard materials, use **Auto Focus**.
   - For soft materials, manually adjust the laser head to the appropriate height.

5. After focusing is complete, start processing.
