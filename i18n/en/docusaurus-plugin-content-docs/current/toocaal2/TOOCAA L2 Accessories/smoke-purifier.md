# Troubleshooting
**Make sure the power is switched off before inspecting or repairing!**

**Problem 1: **The machine still works, but the air flow is very weak and suction power is greatly reduced.

**Cause:** Air Inlet is blocked or foreign body exists inside the duct. The filter becomes saturated and hence gets blocked and gives an alarm. 

**Solution:** Turn off the power and open the top cover. Check if there is any foreign body blocked in the air inlet. Then check if the air vent is blocked or not. If the suction power of the empty-loaded machine is normal, it means the filter needs to be replaced. 

**Problem 2:** The machine shuts down automatically after it is just started. Even if you restart the machine, the same problem happens again.

**Cause: **The air flow inside the machine is not smooth. The obstruction of the filter is very strong. As a result, the starting current of the fan becomes very high, hence the machine shuts down automatically for self protection. 

**Solution: **Turn off the power and open the top cover. Check if there is any foreign body blocked in the air inlet. Then turn the speed-adjusting knob to the lowest level and restart the machine. The machine will be back to normal.

# Attention
1. The power input of this product shall be used with in the specified nominal voltage scope (subject to power identification on the product body). It's strictly forbidden for the use with excessive high or low voltage, if the ambient voltage is unstable, please turn off the machine, unplug the power plug and use it again when the voltage gets normal.
2. While using the machine, the ambient temperature range of the gas and the dust sucked into the air inlet should be: atmospheric temperature ~50°C, never use it when the temperature is higher or lower than this temperature scope.
3. When using the machine, the humidity of the gas and the dust sucked into the air inlet should be between 40%-80%, if the humidity is excessively high, the filter element will become invalid rapidly and the internal circuit will be damaged; never use it when the humidity is higher than 80%.
4. When the machine has primary cotton filter, properly install the primary cotton filter before operation, primary cotton filter can be classified as disposable consumable and never use it again after washing, please replace the primary cotton filter configured by the original manufacturer. Never use the machine without primary cotton filter or with poor primary cotton filter(poor or washed primary cotton filter over the market performs poorly and medium and high-eciency filter element in the subsequent stages will be blocked up or become invalid quickly and cause greater losses).
5. It's strictly forbidden to use this machine without a filter element, because the cooking fume or the dust particle sucked in the machine directly would cause damage to airblower and control system. Any fault caused by machine use under the aforesaid status shall be serviced at the user's own cost, therefor greater losses can be caused.
6. It's not permitted to continue to use the machine when the filter element or the filter cotton is blocked up. This will greatly shorten the service life of the machine, even damage the machine, please clean and maintain the machine regularly and replace the it accordingly.
7. In case your machine filter element is blocked up, the suction force is lowered or the filter element for foreign odor removal fails for foreign odor removal, it's not permitted to use this machine by reducing the machine's number of layers of the filter elements or without putting in primary filter element or cotton. Please replace it with the filter configured by the original manufacturer.
8. It is strictly prohibited to open the inside of the machine privately formaintenance. We are not responsible for any damage caused by this behaviour and this is also not covered by warranty.
