# Story of TOOCAA L2
## Made for your inspiration
**Creation is everyone's desire and belief in pursuing a better life.**

From the time humans used stones to make arrowheads to the time they used scissors and hacksaws to make daily necessities, the advancement of tools has not liberated human creativity. Therefore, we launched **TOOCAA** to break this limitation and unleash human creative potential. We don't want any inspiration to be buried due to lack of the right tools.
**We believe that tools can be as amazing as works of art.**

TOOCAA L2 uses advanced laser and computer technology to redefine creative tools through industrial design, making creation efficient and safe.

As an excellent desktop laser engraving and cutting machine, TOOCAA L2 always adheres to user needs as the core and regards safety as our top priority. TOOCAA L2 is equipped with an intelligent safety system. It combines patented flame detection technology, body tilt detection technology, and smart protective cover switch detection technology to ensure the safety of all users during use. For school and home users, we have specially designed a **USB child safety lock** and an **optional emergency stop switch function**, which is easy to operate and ensures user safety.

The charm of TOOCAA L2 goes far beyond this. The smart protective cover can effectively block lasers and smoke, allowing you to enjoy high performance while keeping your working environment clean. TOOCAA L2 also adds some designs to enhance the user experience, such as a built-in fill light strip, allowing you to keep track of the machine's operating status at any time. In addition, the smoke exhaust system can quickly exhaust the smoke generated during the operation of the machine, reducing pollution to the working environment.
When designing TOOCAA L2, we pursued the ultimate in technology and paid more attention to the safety of each user. We hope that every user of TOOCAA L2 can deeply feel our persistence and adherence to safety.

**Creativity often comes from a moment of inspiration in life.**
Whether it is a redesign of the product's appearance or a completely new creation from scratch, it is a test for the creator. TOOCAA L2 cherishes every inspiration and is committed to helping people with creative ideas realize their dreams, because **TOOCAA L2 is made for your inspiration**.
