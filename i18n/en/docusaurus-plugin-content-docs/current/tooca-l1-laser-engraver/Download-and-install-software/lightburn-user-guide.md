# LightBurn User Guide

## Preparation

Use a dust-free cloth with alcohol to wipe the protective lens of the laser module before engraving to ensure the best engraving effect.

Put down the wooden board in the working area of TOOCA L1 Laser Engraver, lower the fixing bar, loosen the hand screw on the side of the laser module, and adjust the focus.

The focus bar should be in contact with the surface of the engraving material when it is naturally vertical and downward, use the hand screw on the right side to lock it tightly, and toggle the focus bar clockwise until it is attracted by the magnet. Finally, plug in the laser module cable.

Insert the TF card into the PC.

Double-click the .exe file to install the LightBurn software (the installer inside the TF card is only compatible with Windows 64-bit systems, for other versions, please visit the official website) [https://lightburnsoftware.com/](https://lightburnsoftware.com/)  to downloadã€‚
Note: The free trial period of the software is 30 days, please visit for details of purchasing serial number [https://lightburnsoft-ware.com/collections/frontpage/products/lightburn-gcode](https://lightburnsoft-ware.com/collections/frontpage/products/lightburn-gcode)

Download the configuration file: [TOOCA-Laser-1.7z](https://github.com/elecfreaks/learn-en/raw/master/tooca-laser-1/file/TOOCA%20Laser%201.7z), and decompress it

**Note: In order to protect the table or floor from being burned or smoked, please take care of protecting the table (such as matting the steel plate and other materials that the laser does not easily penetrate), and when laser cutting is carried out, the bottom of the cutting place should be overhanging to ensure the cutting effect.**
