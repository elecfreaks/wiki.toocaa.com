# Recommended parameters

## Notes

1.Please ensure that the focal length of the laser
module is correct and the lens of the laser module
is clean when powered off(It can be clean with the
dustless cloth and alcohol).

2.The parameters are for reference only because
the color of the material is different and it will
lead to a different effect.You can achieve a
desired effect by adjusting the parameters:
Generally higher power or slower speed make deeper
effect; Lower power or faster speed make shallower
effect.

3.The bottom surface of the cutting place should
be suspended when cutting.You should protect the
workbench (such as using steel plates or other
materials that are not easily penetrated by
laser).
