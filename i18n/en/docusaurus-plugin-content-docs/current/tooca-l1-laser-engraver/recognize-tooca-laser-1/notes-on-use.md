# Notes on Use

Laser engraving machines use a high-density laser beam to irradiate materials when engraving or cutting them, creating high temperatures on the surface of the material with the goal of vaporizing the material without burning it. However, most materials are flammable by nature and may ignite and create an open flame which may burn the machine and its surroundings.
Please follow the following operating principles.
