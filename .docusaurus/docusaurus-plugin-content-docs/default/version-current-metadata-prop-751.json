The shield ornaments around the long horn of six different sizes, constitute the Halberd dragon that big scary neck shield, this neck shield can not only scare the enemy. This neck shield generally grows spectacularly beautiful in strong and powerful males but is not developed in females, so experts speculate that its role is mainly for a display to attract the attention of the opposite sex. Because this neck shield looks very much like the ancient Chinese weapon in the halberd, it was figuratively named the halberd dragon. The strong limbs of the halberd dragon support the huge body. The horns of the halberd dragon and the bone spikes of the neck shield are like a sharp sword, which is a terrible weapon to turn defense into attack. The beak like a parrot's curved beak can cut to feed on the leaves of low plants. The halberd dragon's snout horn, about 60 cm long, is the main weapon when attacking.",

      "description": "Laser engraving machines use a high-density laser beam to irradiate materials when engraving or cutting them, creating high temperatures on the surface of the material with the goal of vaporizing the material without burning it. However, most materials are flammable by nature and may ignite and create an open flame which may burn the machine and its surroundings.",
